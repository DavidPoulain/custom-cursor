# custom-cursor
The goal of this code is making a custom cursor that I can use on futur project like my personnal website / portfolio.

## Demo

## update 13.03.22
I manage to hide the custom cursor when the cursor is over an iframe. 
I did with help of stackoverflow : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60226410/hide-custom-cursor-when-mouseover-on-iframe

###### second update of the day

I turn my JS code into Object (`cursorObject`). Not sure it's 100% optimized. I will try to improve it. Feel free to make comment.

## update 23.04.22
Just merger my js-object branch into main.

## Next update ?
I will try to optimize the object and customize the cursor even more.

I used this video from DesignCourse, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfpRZ2t_BrQ, as a base to make that custom cursor.
