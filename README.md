# custom-cursor
The goal of this code is making a custom cursor that I can use on futur project like my personnal website / portfolio.

## upadate 13.03.22
I manage to hide the custom cursor when the cursor is over an iframe. 
I did with help of stackoverflow : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60226410/hide-custom-cursor-when-mouseover-on-iframe
